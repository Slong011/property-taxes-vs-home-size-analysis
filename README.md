# Real Estate Property Tax Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between residential home size (square footage) and the amount of property taxes paid. Using a sample of 10 properties, a scatter plot visualization and statistical tests were conducted to determine if a significant correlation exists between home size and property tax amount.

The correlation coefficient of 0.77 suggests a strong linear relationship. Hypothesis testing shows sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that property tax amount increases with square footage.
